Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
